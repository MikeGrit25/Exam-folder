# Startup Award project
 Examination project on intermediate JavaScript
 presenting a single-page website I built called Startup Awards Showcase. It’s designed to highlight innovative startups, support entrepreneurs, and celebrate excellence.

The site features:

A hero image slider that showcases key themes like technology, innovation, and engineering.

An About Us section that explains our mission.

A dynamic Our Services area, highlighting how we assist startups—from business plans to investor networking.

A Current Startups section powered by an API that displays real startup profiles in a modern, animated card layout.

An Award Recipients grid recognizing top-performing startups with images and links to their websites.

A personal Developer Profile card that reveals my name, education, residence, and contact information—when clicked.

And finally, a professional footer to wrap everything together.

We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, added smooth transitions, a responsive layout, and deployed it using GitHub Pages, making it fully accessible online."
